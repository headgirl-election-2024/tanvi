            <p class="custom-text">My vision</p>
            <p>The perspective I hold for DMC is to foster a vibrant community where every student feels valued and empowered. I aim
                to promote inclusivity, academic excellence, and personal growth. Through collaboration and innovation, we will
                create a supportive environment that encourages leadership, creativity, and lifelong learning. Together, let's make
                our school a place where everyone thrives. My campaign includes the following initiatives, which I believe will significantly enhance DMC:</p>
            <div class="bullet-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Firstly, I'd like to re-open clubs such as the Book Club and the Journalism Club to promote reading and writing. I’d
                        also like to bring back the eco-life club to promote sustainability.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>As head girl, I’d also encourage outdoor learning. (For ex: During activity periods. I’ll explain in detail during
                        my face-to-face campaign.)</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>I also plan on doing a lot of interclass competitions and activities such as interclass debates, chess and art
                        competitions, and other sports activities.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Reviving the Sports Club will lead to the recruitment of new members, and activities such as football, badminton,
                        basketball, and volleyball tournaments will also take place for sports lovers! </li>
                        <br>
                    <li>I’ve been told that there’s a lack of gym and sports equipment at school. I’ll try my best to introduce new gears
                        for y’all to train.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>I’d ensure that our school attends talks (for ex: Career Guidance, psychological well-being, communication skills
                        enhancement, etc…) </li>
                        <br>
                    <li>I believe that communication is the key to improvement and therefore I’d conduct regular meetings with classes to
                        get feedback and y’all’s opinions.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>I’m all ears for new ideas about improvements that can be made to the school or any ideas or designs you have in
                        mind for the school jackets and uniforms.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>I’d also organize some “out–of–school” fundraising activities (that is, activities done out of the school compound
                        to raise money and awareness. Details will be communicated during my face-to-face campaign) </li>
                        <br>
                    <li>I believe that each student of DMC has the right to express his opinion and therefore I’ll put a link on the
                        official Insta page of DMC where any anonymous communication could be done via student to the head team.</li>
                </ul>
